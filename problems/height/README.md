# Height

In this problem, we'll be programmatically determining the height of a binary tree. The height of a tree is the number of levels of nodes (equivalent to the length of the longest path from root to leaf). An empty tree always has the height `0` whereas a tree containing a single node has height `1`, etc..

####Instructions
Write a member function for the `BinaryTree` class named `height`, which will return that tree's height.

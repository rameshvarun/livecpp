# Determine if a Binary Tree is Balanced

![](http://i.imgur.com/u9fP56X.jpg)

A tree is balanced if both its left and right subtrees are also balanced trees whose heights differ by _at most_ 1. An empty (`NULL`) tree is balanced by definition.

####Instructions
Write a function `isBalanced` that returns a boolean value, `true` if the given tree is balanced, `false` otherwise. The function should return `true` if the tree is empty.
